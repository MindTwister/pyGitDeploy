pyGitDeploy
===========

A script for rapid deployment to FTP servers.
The script uses git to find changes since last deployment and applies the changes to an FTP server, if no previous deployment has been made it uploads all watched files.


Rationale
-----
Most shared hosting environments dont allow ssh, let alone git. To make sure all relevant changes are uploaded when your project reaches its next iteration this script runs a diff between your last deployment and current HEAD then syncs those changes with an FTP server.


New in version:
-----

### 0.5.6 ###
* Now handles submodules

### 0.5.5.4 ###
* Fix bug #4 "Crashes when not run from repo root"

### 0.5.1 - 0.5.5.3 ###
* Default/previous values should now be presented correctly.
* Fixed an issue with binary files, all files are now treated as binary.
* Fixed a bloody stupid mistake when retrieving the hex of the current HEAD
* Now actually deletes the files
* Updated the way the script handles no previous commits (grabs all files with `git ls-files`)
* Verbosity now a parameter
* Added -n or --dry-run for a simulated run (no upload, no directories created remotely)
* More verbosity
* Made it possible to specify a specific state to deploy (in preperation for `git deploy --revert`)
* Better format for default values
* Retains previously input values as default (except for password)

### 0.5 ###
* Now actually saves remote information

Requirements:
-----
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Python](http://www.python.org/)
* [GitPython](http://packages.python.org/GitPython/0.3.1/index.html)

Installation:
-------------
### Windows ###
* Place git-deploy somewhere in your path.

### Linux ###
* Place git-deploy somewhere in your path
* Make the script excutable: `chmod 755 git-deploy`

Usage:
------
Assuming python and this script is in your path:

    git deploy

The script will prompt you for ftp details and start the deployment process.
    
Advanced:

    git deploy [-v <level>| --verbose <level>] [-n | --dry-run] <commit>

* **--dry-run**

  **-n**

 Runs the script without making any remote changes, only saves configuration and tells you what it would have done

* **--verbose**

 **-v**
 
 Runs in verbose mode, the optional parameter specifies _how_ verbose it should be, 0-5
  
  

When specifying a commit this is the commit that will be used to compare with the current commit. See this as a way to override the internally remembered last successful deployment.


Tested environments:
--------------------
### Windows versions: ###
* Windows 7

### Linux versions: ###
* Mint 11-12
* Ubuntu 10+

### Python versions: ###
* 2.7.1

If you have used this script anywhere else with success feel free to send me a message and I will update this document.


Todo for version 1:
--------

* Add active or passive mode to configuration options
* Add `--revert` to quickly go back to last deployment
* Add named deployments
 * Named deployments should work as aliases for different servers; `git deploy staging` `git deploy production`
* Bind a specific branch to a named deployment to merge config changes. (merge staging branch with current THEN upload)
* Verbosity levels (_work in progress_)
* Document command line options
